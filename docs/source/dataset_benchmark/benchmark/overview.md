# Benchmark Overview

With the collected tasks, assets, and trajectories, RoboVerse establishes standardized
benchmarks for robot learning, including both imitation learning and
reinforcement learning. We define a unified training and evaluation protocol within
the RoboVerse platform and implement standardized baselines and learning frameworks
for benchmarking. Specifically, for imitation learning, we introduce different
levels of generalization benchmarks to assess the generalization capability of
models.

The generalization benchmark is based on randomization options that automatically applied to any task. We implemented it as an environment wrapper.
