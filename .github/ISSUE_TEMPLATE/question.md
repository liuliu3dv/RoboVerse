### Question

Basic questions, related to robot learning, that are not bugs or feature requests will be closed without reply, because GitHub issues are not an appropriate venue for these.

Advanced/nontrivial questions, especially in areas where documentation is lacking, are very much welcome.

For questions that are related to running and understanding the underlying simulators that MetaSim uses, please post them at their respective forums.
